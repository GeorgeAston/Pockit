            <h2>Privacy Policy for Pockit</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 18, 2025</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Currently, Pockit does not collect any personal information that is transmitted to our servers. All reminder data you enter into Pockit is stored locally within your web browser's local storage.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally, we do not use your information for any purposes beyond providing the reminder functionality within your browser. We do not access, track, or analyze your reminder data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
            <p>Your reminders are stored directly in your browser's local storage. This means the data is tied to your specific browser on your device. If you use a different browser or device, your reminders will not automatically be synchronized.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>As your reminder data is stored locally, it is not shared with us or any third parties.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>As we do not collect or store your data on our servers, many traditional data privacy rights (such as the right to access, rectify, or erase personal data held by us) do not apply. However, you have control over the data stored in your browser's local storage. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>View your reminders:</strong> By simply using the Pockit web app.</li>
                <li><strong>Modify your reminders:</strong> Through the app's interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Delete your reminders:</strong> Individually using the delete button or by clearing your browser's local storage for this website.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            <p>While your data is stored locally in your browser, you should be aware of the security practices of your browser and device. We do not implement specific security measures for locally stored data beyond what your browser provides.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>As Pockit evolves, we may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. If we introduce features that involve collecting or transmitting user data, we will provide a more comprehensive Privacy Policy and obtain your consent where required.</p>
        </section>
