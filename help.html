                <h3>1. Adding New Reminders</h3>

                    <li><strong>Simple Text Input:</strong> You can quickly add a new reminder by clicking the "Add New Reminder" button. A prompt will appear asking you to enter the description of your reminder. Simply type in what you need to be reminded of and press "OK".</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Once added, your reminder is stored directly in your browser's local storage. This means your reminders are saved on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    <li><strong>Clear List Display:</strong> All your active reminders are displayed in a clear and chronological list under the "Your Reminders" heading.</li>
                    <li><strong>"No reminders yet" Message:</strong> If you haven't added any reminders, or if you've deleted all of them, a friendly "No reminders yet. Add one!" message will be displayed.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Individual Deletion:</strong> Each reminder in the list has a "Delete" button next to it. Clicking this button will remove that specific reminder from your list and from your browser's local storage.</li>

                <h3>4. Progressive Web App (PWA) Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Installable:</strong> Pockit can be installed to your device's home screen or app launcher, behaving like a native application. Look for the "Install" option in your browser's menu (usually three dots or a similar icon).</li>
                    <li><strong>Offline Access (Basic):</strong> Once you have loaded Pockit in your browser, the basic structure of the app should be accessible even if you temporarily lose your internet connection. However, adding or deleting reminders requires the app to be running in your browser.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>5. Privacy Focused</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> All your reminder data is stored securely within your own browser's local storage. We do not collect, store, or share your personal information or your reminders on any external servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> For more detailed information, please refer to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
