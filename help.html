                            <li><strong>Upcoming Reminders:</strong> Reminders due within the next 24 hours will have a muted orange/gold background, helping you prioritise with ease.</li>
                            <li>These highlights automatically update as time passes.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Installable:</strong> Pockit can be installed to your device's home screen or app launcher, behaving like a native application. Look for the "Install" option in your browser's menu (usually three dots or a similar icon).</li>
