            <h2>Tagging Reminders (New &amp; Improved!)</h2>
            <p>Tags help you organize your reminders into categories like 'Work', 'Home', 'Personal', 'Shopping', etc. They are now managed through a new dropdown system, allowing for powerful multi-selection.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Adding a Tag to a Reminder:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When adding or editing a reminder in the modal, simply type your desired tag into the "Tag (Optional)" field.</li>
                        <li>Existing tags you've used will appear as suggestions as you type.</li>
                        <li>If you leave the tag field empty, or your reminder does not have a tag, it will automatically be assigned the default 'all' tag for easy viewing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Filtering Reminders by Tag:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On the main screen, locate and click the **"Filter Tags"** button. A dropdown menu containing your tags will appear.</li>
                        <li>The menu lists all unique tags you've used, plus an "All Tags" option.</li>
                        <li><strong>To view all reminders:</strong> Select the **"All Tags"** checkbox. This will automatically deselect any other tags you might have chosen, ensuring every reminder is displayed regardless of its specific tag.</li>
                        <li><strong>To view reminders with specific tags:</strong> Check one or more of the individual tag checkboxes (e.g., 'Work', 'Personal', 'Urgent').</li>
                        <li>You can select multiple tags simultaneously to see reminders that match *any* of the chosen tags (e.g., check both 'Work' and 'Urgent' to display reminders tagged as either 'Work' OR 'Urgent').</li>
                        <li>To close the dropdown, click outside the menu or click the "Filter Tags" button again.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Searching Reminders</h2>
            <p>Quickly find specific reminders by typing keywords into the new search bar located above your tag filters.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>How to Search:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click into the **"Search reminders..."** input field.</li>
                        <li>Begin typing your search term. The reminder list will filter automatically and instantly as you type.</li>
                        <li>The search functionality will look for matches in both the reminder's main text content and its assigned tags.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Combining Search and Tag Filters:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can effectively combine the search bar and the tag filters for more precise results.</li>
                        <li>First, filter your reminders by desired tags using the "Filter Tags" dropdown.</li>
                        <li>Then, use the search bar to refine those already-filtered results further within the selected tag categories.</li>
                        <li>For example, if you filter by the 'Work' tag, then type "meeting" into the search bar, you'll see only your 'Work' reminders that contain the word "meeting".</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Automatic Refresh &amp; Highlighting</h2>
            <p>Your reminders list automatically refreshes every minute to keep statuses and due dates up-to-date without you needing to refresh the page manually.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reminders approaching their due date (within the next 24 hours) are highlighted in **yellow** for quick visibility.</li>
                <li>Overdue reminders (those with a past date/time) appear in **red**.</li>

            <h2>Pop-up Notifications</h2>
            <p>Beyond the "Undo" pop-up for completed tasks, Pockit Reminders may occasionally display a small feedback pop-up at the bottom of your screen. This is designed to appear periodically (e.g., every 4 weeks) to gather your thoughts on the app's functionality and help us improve.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can dismiss this pop-up, and it won't appear again for a set period.</li>
            </ul>
