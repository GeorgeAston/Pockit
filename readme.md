## What is Pockit?

Pockit is a straightforward and easy-to-use web application designed to help you set and manage reminders for your everyday tasks. Accessible directly through your web browser and installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA), Pockit aims to be your reliable "pocket pal" for keeping track of what's important.

## Current Functionality

As of the current version, Pockit offers the following core features:

### 1. Adding New Reminders

* **Simple Text Input:** You can quickly add a new reminder by clicking the "Add New Reminder" button. A prompt will appear asking you to enter the description of your reminder. Simply type in what you need to be reminded of and press "OK".
* **Local Storage:** Once added, your reminder is stored directly in your browser's local storage. This means your reminders are saved on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers.

### 2. Viewing Your Reminders

* **Clear List Display:** All your active reminders are displayed in a clear and chronological list under the "Your Reminders" heading.
* **"No reminders yet" Message:** If you haven't added any reminders, or if you've deleted all of them, a friendly "No reminders yet. Add one!" message will be displayed.

### 3. Deleting Reminders

* **Individual Deletion:** Each reminder in the list has a "Delete" button next to it. 
>[!CAUTION]
> Clicking this button will remove that specific reminder from your list and from your browser's local storage.
